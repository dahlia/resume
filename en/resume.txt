Summary
-------

I first encountered computers and the internet in 1995,
and started coding in 2000 when I was in middle school.
In 2004, when I was still in high school,
I started outsourcing software production on a freelance basis,
and have worked as a full-time professional software engineer since 2007.
I've contributed to free/open source software since I was a student.
I am not only obsessed with technology,
but also view software development as work and value teamwork and collaboration.
My strengths are that I am good at synthesizing complex situations,
and taking conflicting opinions and building consensus,
which is what my colleagues often tell about me.

Interests
   - Free/open source softwares: have founded and contributed to many
     F/OSS projects
   - Decentralized systems: peer-to-peer networking, Byzantine agreements, and
     blockchains
   - Network programming: implementing asynchronous event-driven servers
     and clients
   - Domain-specific languages: designing and implementing DSLs
   - Functional programming: familiar with immutable data structures,
     recursions, deterministic functions, abstract data types,
     and statically typed languages
   - Automated tests: unit tests, property-based tests, and integration tests
   - Software internationalization and localization: translation, Unicode,
     Unicode CLDR, Unicode Han Database, CJK in general
   - Technical writing: writing design papers and documenting legacy code,
     both in Korean and English

Skills
   - Languages: Korean (mother tongue), English, Japanese
   - Programming languages: Haskell, C#, Python, TypeScript, Bash, SQL
   - Platforms: .NET/Mono, Deno
   - Databases: PostgreSQL, SQLite, RocksDB
   - Et cetera: Linux, Git, Mercurial, Docker
